						<p>This program is all about a journey - a journey to learn about self-care for dealing with depression and maintaining well-being. It is important that you familiarize yourself with the signboard you would come across during the entire program.</p>
						<p>Treat the various sections in the different zones as a series of driving lessons with space for gaining new information, discovering your strengths and weaknesses, watching a demonstration and of course practicing your skills. </p>

							more when we see ourselves as not moving sufficiently or
							remind ourselves that we are doing alright and we need to
							appreciate ourselves and keep going. <br> Progress
							tracker focuses on your efforts and not on outcomes. This
							is because, focusing on efforts (rather than worrying about
							and waiting for outcomes) and rewarding ourselves for
							making small efforts is the best approach to motivate
							ourselves.

						<strong>Our Strong Recommendations and TIPS for you
							about completing PUSH-D program:</strong>
					</p>
					<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
						<li><strong>Total duration : </strong>For maximum
							benefits, we recommend that you make all attempts to
							complete the program within 1.5 months of registering for
							the same.</li>
						<li><strong>Frequency of engaging with the
								program/number of slots per week : </strong>Regularity and
							continuity are critical for deriving benefit of this
							self-care program.</li>
						<li>We suggest you to keep aside at least two slots on
							two different weekdays (non-consecutive day, e.g. Monday
							and Thursday rather than Monday and Tuesday) for working on
							this program. This way, you are likely to finish the
							program in about one and half months to two months at the
							most.</li>
						<li><strong>Your slot is your session : </strong>A slot
							here refers to a continuous time period during which you go
							over the contents of the program and complete the exercises
							contained therein. A slot is similar to a session that
							people might have with a therapist/counsellor in
							face-to-face interactions.</li>
						<li><strong>Slot-duration : </strong>As this is a
							self-care program, we recommend you to keep each slot for
							minimum 20 minutes and maximum up to 45 minutes.</li>
						<li><strong>Time-estimates for various
								sections : </strong>We have provided a rough estimate of the time
							required to complete each section, which may help you to
							plan as you move from one section to the next. <br>If
							you were just mechanically/passively reading the content
							under each of the sections, you might just finish it in a
							very short period of time. But, this may not be of much
							use! <br>We would want you to take your time to think
							about what you are reading as well as during the interval
							period between slots when you are trying to apply what you
							read. <br>We encourage you to go over the content in
							each section at least one more time after you have gone
							over it once. This is similar to what happens in direct
							face to face sessions with a therapist, wherein a few key
							ideas may be discussed in more than one session so that you
							can consolidate your learning and see its personal
							relevance. <br>In the time-estimates and the
							recommended number of sessions provided at the start of
							each section take in account the time needed to go over the
							section more than once.</li>
						<li><strong>Apply and Practice : </strong>You will
							derive maximum benefit when you try to apply and practice
							what you discover /learn during your sessions. We recommend
							that you use your workbook and complete various exercises
							and keep a record of how you apply in your daily life
							whatever you learn in the program.</li>
						<li><strong>Schedule your next slot and
								receive a mobile reminder : </strong>At the end of each slot, you
							have the facility of scheduling your next slot for
							yourself. A mobile prompt will be sent as a reminder to you
							on the day you have scheduled the next slot.</li>
						<li><strong>Tele-Assist : </strong>We will also be
							making telephonic calls on once a week basis to help you in
							completing this self-care program. <br>These calls
							will be made on pre-decided days and timings that would be
							discussed with you in advance, during the evaluation
							session. <br>These calls would be brief (lasting 15-20
							minutes) and are NOT meant to substitute the self-care
							program/ face to face sessions with a professional. These
							are merely meant to keep up your motivation to make efforts
							to help yourself as well as to discuss any problems being
							faced during the program completion. These calls will also
							help us determine if you might require a different form of
							treatment if your symptoms have changed/increased in
							severity and advise you accordingly.</li>
						<li><strong>Connect over email : </strong>You may
							choose to drop us a mail to clarify your doubts regarding
							the program exercises etc. Such e- mails would be responded
							to within three working days.</li>
